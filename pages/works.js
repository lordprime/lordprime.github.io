          <WorkGridItem3 thumbnail={thumbMargelo} title="AI based Enumeration and Exploit suggester">
            This research is intended to implement Artificial Intelligence with Cyber Security.
            Our main goal of this research is to make an AI that can gather information on a 
            specified target and search for the best possible exploits and all the vulnerabilities 
            on the target using tools that are used by a Cyber Sec professional during a Pentest.

          <WorkGridItem4 thumbnail={thumbPichu2} title="API-based network scanning">
            My research focuses on achieving stable and consistent results when scanning networks.
            The scan process can be automated by utilising APIs and containers, avoiding the risk of human error.
            The API-based approach has been fine-tuned through careful analysis and testing to deliver accurate and
            consistent results every time. This method s ensures that the network scan is thorough and reliable.
            Overall, the use of APIs in network scanning provides a reliable and efficient method for achieving consistent results.

          <WorkGridItem5 thumbnail={thumbPichu2} title="System for social engineering using AI">
            In our paper, "System for social engineering using AI",
            my co-authors and I present an innovative approach that utilizes Conversational AI,
            Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Advanced Speech Recognition to execute social engineering
            attacks with remarkable accuracy. We shed light on the potential risks associated
            with AI-driven social engineering, stressing the need for heightened awareness
            and strong defences against evolving cyber threats. Combining AI technologies to
            mimic human-like interactions demonstrates how malicious actors can exploit communication
            vulnerabilities to deceive and manipulate targets. Our work aims to raise awareness,
            promote robust security measures, and encourage ethical AI use for a safer digital environment.

          <WorkGridItem6 thumbnail={thumbPichu2} title="XSS exploit generation using AI">
            Excited to share our latest paper, "XSS exploit generation using AI" Working alongside my co-authors,
            we developed an innovative approach to combat XSS vulnerabilities. By using Conversational AI and a
            specialized LLM model trained in XSS and payload generation, we successfully crafted real-world usable
            XSS payloads with advanced obfuscation. This breakthrough research strengthens cybersecurity, safeguarding
            web applications against malicious attacks. Let's build a more secure digital world together!
